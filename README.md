# BluePill

**Update (Mar 4, 2020):** *An article on BluePill just got accepted at TIFS (see below). We are now extending the documentation! :-)*

**BluePill** is an open-source dynamic analysis framework for handling evasive malware. Its goal is to reconcile the transparency properties needed for automatic analyses with the fine-grained execution inspection and altering capabilities required for manual analysis. BluePill is an academic prototype under active development: as we share it as such, any feedback is greatly appreciated!

BluePill can counter many red pills targeting hypervisors, debuggers, third-party analysis tools (e.g. IDA Pro), and timing artifacts. It builds on dynamic binary instrumentation (DBI) to monitor adversarial queries that a sample can make on the environment looking for artifacts, and fix them when their results would give away the presence of an automated analysis or a human agent.

BluePill offers a GDB remote interface to analysts to debug a sample, complemented by a stealth patching mechanisms to hide code changes made in the debugger from self-checksumming schemes.

We tested BluePill on heterogeneous PE32 malware running on 32-bit Windows 7 SP1: as an example, we can run executables protected with recent versions of VMProtect and Themida, and highly evasive samples like Furtim.

To counter DBI evasions, BluePill uses a [library of mitigations](https://github.com/season-lab/sok-dbi-security/) that we wrote for Intel Pin as part of our paper *SoK: Using Dynamic Binary Instrumentation for Security (And How You May Get Caught Red-Handed)* from ASIACCS 2019. We extended the library with further mitigations for time overheads and red pills targeting the GDB remote debugging interface and exception handling.

BluePill has been presented in:

*Before going public for BH Europe 2019, we made radical changes that negatively affected the handling of 64-bit code and partially of the WoW64 subsystem: please consider these scenarios experimental as we complete the regression fixing behind the scenes.*

### Quick start

BluePill builds on Intel Pin and requires Visual Studio 2015 for its compilation.

Extract a recent release of Pin to your disk drive and change the path-related property value in the Visual Studio project when needed: by default we assume Pin v3.11 installed in `C:\Pin311`. Once compilation ends, you will find a `bluepill32.dll` library in `C:\Pin311`. To run an executable under BluePill use:

```
C:\Pin311\pin.exe -t bluepill32.dll -- <file.exe>
```

*>>> We will shortly add a table of the command-line knobs for the tool and a nicer guide to set up a remote GDB session from IDA Pro over BluePill. Please be patient with us for a little bit longer :-) <<<*

Change the defaults in `config.h` to control the mitigations used by default or to enable command-line knobs for them (in the latter case set the `FIXED_KNOBS` macro to `0`).

To access dissection capabilities of BluePill you need to connect from a debugger to the GDB remote interface of Pin. To this end you need to provide additional options when invoking Pin of the form:

```
C:\Pin311\pin.exe -appdebug â€”appdebug_server_port 10000 -t bluepill32.dll -debugger [other options] -- <file.exe>
```

And connect to the desired port number. The application will stay paused until you connect a debugger, but if you instead attach one to the process you will end up debugging Pin and the JIT-ted code. For IDA Pro users select the *Remote GDB debugger* option and connect to `localhost`. To map missing memory segments you can use the `AddSegments.py` IDAPython script available in the `scripts/` folder: we defined a custom `vmmap` GDB command that gets invoked by the script and transfers memory layout information from the pintool to the debugger.

Exception handling requires a workaround for the current GDB server implementation. When you need to pass an exception to the application just send a `wait` command right after you receive the exception message, then disconnect and reconnect IDA to BluePill, which meanwhile will put the execution on hold in response to the command.
